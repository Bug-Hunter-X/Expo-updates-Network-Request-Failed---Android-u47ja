The solution involved a thorough check of the update URL used within the expo-updates configuration. It turned out there was a minor typo in the URL causing the request to fail.  The correct URL was deployed to the correct server and this resolved the issue. Additionally, ensure that your Android device has the necessary network permissions enabled and is connected to a stable internet connection.   Double-check that the server hosting your updates is reachable and functioning correctly.  Examine server logs for any errors that could hint at the problem. Finally, use a network monitoring tool to observe network requests for clues about the failed updates.
